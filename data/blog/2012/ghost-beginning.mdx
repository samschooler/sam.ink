When I came across the [Ghost](https://web.archive.org/web/20130208070749/http://john.onolan.org/ghost/) while reading HN I really liked it, and have thought about making something similar, but have never gotten around to it. In the last few days though I have put it together just as John described (I donâ€™t know if its legal or morally right to publish it, but I will blog about it at least because I have spent some time on it.

I finished working on the fifth image down in his post, -the post list and preview- I also finished the sixth image, which is the editor with markdown, and preview.

Now I am working on the backend which is created with PHP and the [Slim PHP RESTful application framework](http://slimframework.com/). If you would like to check out the current version of my rendering of Ghost, you can see it on GitHub [here](http://samschooler.github.io/pre_ghost/g-admin/posts.html).
