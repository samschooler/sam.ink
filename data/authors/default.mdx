I am a software engineer living in Colorado. Currently, I work for [Odeko](https://odeko.com) building technology to streamline small business. In the past, I've worked for [Airkit](https://airkit.com), [Thatch Travel](https://thatch.co), [Spire Digital](https://www.spiredigital.com/), and [Truebill](https://truebill.com). I've also founded a (failed) startup called [Wanderlift](https://wanderlift.com) to help people get out and explore the outdoors. Additionally, I built the initial product for [Lynx Global Intelligence](https://lynxglobalintelligence.com) to better understand the world around us via data.

My current passion projects focus on building better relationships between friends, as well as thinking about hyper-local products and games. My other passions include the outdoors, transportation, decentralized systems, and privacy. I like to use rapid dev cycles to design, build, test, and deploy unique and delightful experiences.

In my free time, I rock climb, backcountry ski, hike, bike, travel, and [deliver cookies on rollerblades](/projects/rollerbakers).
