[GeekTool](http://projects.tynsoe.org/en/geektool/) is an awesome tool I use on my desktop every day. It lets you make amazing interactive desktops from the weather to your CPU usage, a geek is at home. This tool is great, but when it comes to memory usage; it sucks. This is why I made a quick geeklet (an interactive piece for GeekTool).

It surprised me that no one has made something similar. What this does is it checks the memory usage of [GeekTool](http://projects.tynsoe.org/en/geektool/), and if it is above a certain threshold, it restarts the app with a slight flicker, but nothing more noticeable.

### To make this work

1. [Download this script (Will Download)](https://github.com/samschooler/GeekTools/blob/master/Scripts/GeekToolSelfMonitor.scpt?raw=true)
2. Change the threshold to what you like
3. Move the file to where you like
4. [Download this geeklet (Will Download)](https://github.com/samschooler/GeekTools/raw/master/Geeklets/Monitor.glet?download=true)
5. Edit the geeklet command to point to your script you downloaded
6. Upvote my post on [macosxtips here](http://www.macosxtips.co.uk/geeklets/system/auto-memory-monitor-for-geektool/)
